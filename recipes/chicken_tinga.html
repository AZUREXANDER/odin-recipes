            <li>3 ½ lb chicken breasts</li>
            <li>3 white onion, 1/2 in chunks, the rest thinly sliced</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>5 Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo + some of their sauce (use the entire can like me for more spice)</li>
            <li>½ tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Mazola Corn Oil</li>
            <li>For serving (tostadas, refried beans, shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes, crumbled queso fresco or cotija, Mexican crema or sour cream)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>  
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, cut slits into the chicken breasts, add to the pot along with 1/2 of an onion, all the garlic, bay leaves, salt & pepper. Boil for 20 minutes.</li> 
        <li>3 ½ lb chicken breasts</li>
        <li>3 white onion, 1/2 in chunks, the rest thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes of boiling the chicken, add in the tomatoes & boil for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the pot and set aside, take out all the garlic, onion and tomatoes and reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, onion, tomatoes to a blender along with 1 cup of the cooking water, the cumin & Mexican oregano, the chipotle peppers, blend until smooth, taste for seasonings & add salt/pepper to taste if needed. You can also add more of the water if it looks to thin.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has cooled, shred it to your desired consistency, I like to leave it in slightly bigger pieces so I use two forks, for a finer shred, use the mixer method.</li>
        <li>To a large skillet on medium heat, add the Mazola corn oil, once hot, add all the sliced onions and cook for 5-7 minutes or until softened and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the onion and combine well. Add the shredded chicken and mix to combine. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>To serve your tinga, get tostadas, slather with refried beans, then the tinga, then garnish with shredded cabbage, tomatoes, Mexican crema & crumbled queso.</li>
        <li>Any leftover tinga freezes perfectly so itll last longer. Works great for meal preps as well</li>
    </ol>
